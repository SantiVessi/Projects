# Projects
Academic Projects for my Master's Degree in Data Science

1. **abstract**: Abstract of my thesis: Time-varying differential network analysis from tumor-educated platelet transcriptome to
capture mechanisms of tumor progression
2. **Understanding Drinking Behavior Through Bayesian Analysis**: This project analyzes the relationship between alcohol consumption and health indicators using Bayesian statistical modeling. It applies logistic and probit regression models to predict drinking status based on demographic, physiological, and biochemical variables from National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) health dataset (Korea), sampled to 5,000 observations.
3. **Exploring the Relationship Between Socio-Economic Determinants and Smoking Rates in the EU**: This report leverages datasets from Eurostat  and the World Health Organization (WHO) to explore how socio-economic factors influence tobacco consumption. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and clustering techniques to uncover patterns in smoking behavior across demographics like gender, age, education, income, and urbanization.
4. **Analysis of the Human Interactome: Fragilities and Their Implications for Alzheimer's Disease**: it examines the human protein-protein interaction network (interactome) to identify structural fragilities and their relevance to Alzheimer's disease. The study uses network analysis techniques, including percolation, community detection, and link prediction algorithms, to model disease mechanisms and predict potential disease-related genes. Other contributors: Riccardo Corrente, Pietro Sciabbarrasi.
